# Analysis-of-mobile-phones-listings-on-Jumia
I scraped data on the Jumia mobile phones on sale category namely the details and the price.<br>
I then proceeded to clean the data and create tables to show:<br>
  i. The brand<br>
  ii. The storage<br>
  iii. The RAM<br> 
  iv. If the mobile phone is dual sim or not.<br>
I plan to fit a model that will be able to predict the mobile phone price based on the features I have listed above.
